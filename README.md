# Honours-Thesis-2021
As a commitment to open source science I present the code used in my honour's thesis. This includes Python, MATLAB and Bash scripts. Massive thanks to Ash and Sid for teaching me how to code throughout my honours year.

My thesis uses normative modelling (https://github.com/amarquand/PCNtoolkit) to map the heterogeneous cortical structure of depression at the level of the individual. Along with this I performed a permutation test using Permutation Analysis of Linear Models (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/PALM) to assess regional group differences defined by the Schaefer Atlas (https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG/tree/master/stable_projects/brain_parcellation/Schaefer2018_LocalGlobal).
